										<h2>Intro</h2>

									<p>Bellow are some of the best Romanticist artist that have ever been. Romanticism celebrated the individual imagination and intuition in the enduring search for individual rights and liberty. Its ideals of the creative, subjective powers of the artist fueled avant-garde movements. Romanticist practitioners found their voices across all genres, including literature, music, art, and architecture. Reacting against the sober style of Neoclassicism preferred by most countries' academies, the far reaching international movement valued originality, inspiration, and imagination, thus promoting a variety of styles within the movement. Additionally, in an effort to stem the tide of increasing industrialization, many of the Romanticists emphasized the individual's connection to nature and an idealized past. </p>

												<h3>Eugène Delacroix</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Eugène Delacroix was born on April 26, 1798, near Paris, in Charenton-Saint-Maurice. The house of his birth has become a media library in the city of Saint-Maurice. At only twenty-four years of age, Delacroix submitted his first work to the Salon of 1882. When he was born, his father, Charles Delacroix, held an important position as Minister of Foreign Affairs and then as ambassador to Holland. He was later appointed prefect in Marseille, and then Bordeaux, where he died when Eugène was only six years old. His mother, Victoire Delacroix, was the daughter of renowned cabinetmaker, Jean-François Oeben, who worked for King Louis XV.</p>

												<h3>J. M. W. Turner</h3>
											</header>
											<p>J. M.W. Turner began his artistic career at a very young age. His success was fairly immediate, selling his first painting at just 12 years old. He continued to accomplish significant achievements at a remarkably young age, some that people others would never have the privilege of experiencing. Turner was born the son of a barber. Though he would maintain a very close relationship with his father later in his life, young Turner was sent to live with his uncle. He was just 10 years old. Just two years later his drawings were purchased by his father's clientele who could early identify the artist's budding talent. </p>

												<h3>Théodore Géricault</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Géricault was a dandy and an avid horseman whose dramatic paintings reflect his flamboyant and passionate personality. One of the first great exponents of 19th century French Painting, and of the style known as Romanticism, Theodore Gericault lived as well as painted with all the verve of the Romantic style. Blessed with independent wealth, he could indulge his twin passions, for painting and horses, as and when he wished. As a student, Géricault learned the traditions of English sporting art from the French painter Carle Vernet, and he developed a remarkable facility for capturing animal movement. He also mastered classicist figure construction and composition under the academician Pierre-Narcissse, Baron Guérin. </p>
