										<h1>Portrait of Mehmet II</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Mehmeed II.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Bellini was sent to Constantinople with two journeyman assistants without the Doge who
declined the wedding invitation. Despite the words of the Koran baning artistic
representation of the human figure, the Sultan enjoyed European art. We can see this
connection to the Sultans childhood where he has childish sketches of human heads and
owls in his school exercise books. This childhood enthusiasm for European art would
have had an influence in the treaty signed in 1479 after a 16-year war between the
Venetian and Ottoman. We have very little information on the details of Bellini’ stay in
Constantinople but there are testimonies from other people who lived in the court of the
Sultan who has written about the relationship between Bellini and the Sultan. This
friendly relationship between the two would have been key to spread the cross-cultural
art around Europe and helped the relationship between the two cities in regards to the
treaty.</p>
									<p>When Bellini left Constantinople he added Turkish clothes figures to his works which
spread the interest of Turkish art in Venice. It helped that Bellini’s “Portrait of Mehmet
II” was being spread around Europe as well, increasing interest of Turkish art. In regards
to the painting of “Portrait of Mehmet II”, we can see many elements both European and
Turkish. The European elements include the medium. Working with oil paint on canvas
and painting human figures are European. The Koran bans the artistic representation of
the human figure so the fact that the Sultan wanted a portrait of himself shows how much
he likes European art. The painting is in a classical style which was very common in
Europe during the time. The lighting and shadow on the Sultan, the use of depth, the way
he is sitting, and the angle of his head are all elements seen in European paintings that
help make the subject look 3D. This again will be due to the ban of artistic representation
of the human figure in Turkey but I don’t doubt that he Sultan would have had a few
demands of how he was portrayed. As many European artist do, Bellini has used the arch
surrounding the Sultan and the embroidered fabric to move the viewer’s attention around
the painting. The use of the colour red also does this but vertically instead of circular. In
most European portraits the subject is looking forward but this the Sultan’s, he is looking
to the right. This enforces a different type of power than European portraits give. You can
tell even without the crows in the image that this man is important but not in the
traditional European way.</p>
									<p>The way that we can visually see Turkish culture in this work is through the iconography.
The Turkish dress and the embroidered cloth are two main elements that show this is a
cross-cultural painting. The crown on the embroidered cloth is said to represent the
Sultans rule and the six on either side of his head are for the six Sultans who came before
him. These elements move the painting away from being just a European painting of a
Turkish man, but a painting with both Turkish and European influences by a European
for a Turkish Sultan. The lack of a detailed background in this work may also be a
Turkish element that is seen in many other Turkish portraits. The lack of detail in the
background allows the viewer to focus on the Sultan and the iconography. The Turkish
designs seen in mosaics is shown the cloth in front of the Sultan and more intricate details
can be seen on the arch.</p>
